# Fitting Hierarchical Bayesian Models With Selection Effects in Astronomy

This is a talk that I gave at FWAM (Flatiron-Wide Autumn Meeting, formerly
Flatiron-Wide Algorithms and Mathmatics).  It is a rather technical introduction
to fitting astronomoical catalogs that are subject to measurement uncertainty
and selection effects.
